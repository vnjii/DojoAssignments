            <h3>Javacrsipt Basics</h3>
            <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility  for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Java√çcript lives inside a host environmet(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.  </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffe, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x </li>
              <li> <a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables- out cup now has coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x=10 </li>
              <li> <a href="">Data Types</a> Datatypes are an important concept;to be able to operate an variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaSript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number-42 0r 3.14159; String-"Coding Dojo Rocks!";Array-[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo';and Object - {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'} </li>
              <li> <a href="">Coditionals</a> When you write acode, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting differnt code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this blockof code. </li>
              <li> <a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times, imagine you have to run a mile,well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop. </li>
              <li> <a href="">Function</a> Fuctions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putiing together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly ther are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again. </li>
