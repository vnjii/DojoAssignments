           <h2>About me</h2>

           About.. Hello! I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer who is currently open
           for career opportunities as a front end or back-end developer in the Greater Seattle Area.
           I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located Bellevue, WA that teaches 3 full stack in 3 months.
           I'm capable of learning new technologies very quickly, and am always looking for opportunities to further expand my
           skills and grow as a developer.
